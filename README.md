This a very simple weather app created so that it can tell the user the weather in his location. It also aids him/her 
to search for the weather of a particular location and then getting on to the screen.

Through this app learnt how to perform asynchronous tasks in Dart file, learnt how to deal with networks using Dart package, read json files
and most of it all worked with API of openWeather website using the geolocator package.
